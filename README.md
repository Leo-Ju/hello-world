# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository - just a starting place for trying out this platform.

Hi! I'm Leo, 28 y/o and a data analyst who wants to become a famous data science man when he's all grown up. I'm a music geek with a fascination for mind more than matter, and also I like writing tidy pipes 'n' loops in R.
